"""VizRunner <-> controls integration.

These cover the seam the per-module tests structurally cannot: VizRunner
copies the lists it is handed, so a controls-side shape or lock-mode swap
only lands if the runner resolves it live. Without this, switching to
cylinder kept feeding the hidden quad and the feed went black.
