"""Unit tests for JointSe3PoseOutput in isaacteleop.schema.

JointSe3PoseOutput is a FlatBuffers table for a sparse set of tracked joint poses:
- joints: JointSe3Pose entries keyed by JointName, sorted ascending on the wire
- device_id: stable identity of the producing device

A joint absent from joints is not tracked; there is no per-joint validity flag.
Timestamps are carried by JointSe3PoseOutputRecord, not JointSe3PoseOutput.

Note: Python code should only READ this data (created by C++ trackers), not modify it.
