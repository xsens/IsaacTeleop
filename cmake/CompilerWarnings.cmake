# isaac_teleop_enable_compiler_warnings() applies the project's warning set to the
# CALLING directory scope, which CMake then inherits into every subdirectory added
# after the call. It is called at the top of src/CMakeLists.txt and
# examples/CMakeLists.txt -- the roots of the two first-party trees -- so the flags
# follow the directory layout. Third-party trees (OpenXR SDK, yaml-cpp, pybind11,
# mcap, flatbuffers, Catch2, ...) live under deps/, which never calls this, and so
# keep building with their own flags whatever order the root adds things in.
#
# Directory scoping does not cover code fetched from *inside* src/plugins/, which
# does inherit these flags. See the third-party containment scope at the bottom of
# this file for how those trees opt out.

# Ordering keeps deps/ clean, but it cannot help a tree fetched from *inside* an
# already-flagged directory: a subdirectory snapshots the COMPILE_OPTIONS directory
# property at the point it is added, so anything the plugins pull in via FetchContent
# would inherit our flags. That is not hypothetical — the OAK plugin fetches DepthAI,
# which fetches XLink, and XLink does not build at -Wall -Wextra -Werror.
#
# Wrap any such add_subdirectory() or FetchContent_MakeAvailable() in this pair. It
# clears the calling directory's COMPILE_OPTIONS for the duration and restores them
# afterwards, so the fetched tree builds with its own flags while first-party targets
# declared later in the same file still get ours:
#
#     isaac_teleop_third_party_scope_begin()
#     FetchContent_MakeAvailable(some_dependency)
#     isaac_teleop_third_party_scope_end()

# These are macros rather than functions on purpose: add_subdirectory() and the
# property writes have to happen in the caller's directory scope, not a nested one.
