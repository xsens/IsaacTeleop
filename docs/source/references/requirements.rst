System Requirements
===================

Isaac Teleop can be used for teleoperation of robots, data collection, and human-centric data
collection. The hardware & software requirements are different for each use case.

Teleoperation to Robots with Input Devices

When using extra input devices (such as Manus Gloves, Logitech Rudder Pedals, OAK-D Camera, Haptikos Exoskeletons etc.),
Isaac Teleop needs to be **run on a laptop or workstation**, that is connected to the robot via
network.  The minimum requirements for the laptop/workstation are:

    * - Component
      - Requirement
    * - CPU / GPU
      - x86_64 [#jetson-nano]_, NVIDIA GPU required
    * - OS
      - Ubuntu 22.04 or 24.04
    * - Python
      - 3.11 / 3.12 / 3.13
    * - CUDA
      - 12.8 or newer
    * - NVIDIA Driver
      - 580.95.05 or newer

Teleoperation with Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab
-------------------------------------------

For running simulation with Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab with RTX rendering, the CloudXR server and
Isaac Teleop sessions need to be **run on the same workstation with Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab**. The
workstation's system requirements are driven by Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab [#isaacsim-req]_.

The recommended workstation configuration for Sim-based Teleop is:

    * - Component
      - Requirement
    * - CPU
      - AMD Ryzen Threadripper 7960x
    * - GPU
      - 1x RTX 6000 Pro (Blackwell) or 2x RTX 6000 (Ada)
    * - OS
      - Ubuntu 22.04 [#isaaclab-req]_
    * - Python
      - 3.12 [#isaaclab-req]_
    * - CUDA
      - 12.8 or newer
    * - NVIDIA Driver
      - 580.95.05 or newer

If you are only using XR headsets for teleoperation, you can host the workstation in the cloud.
See `Isaac Lab Cloud Deployment <https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/develop/source/features/docker_cloud.html#cloud-workstations>`_
for more details.

Human-centric Data Collection
------------------------------

Isaac Teleop can also be used for human-centric data collection without a robot or simulator in the
loop. In this case, Isaac Teleop needs to be **run on a laptop or workstation**, that is connected
to device peripherals. The minimum requirements for the laptop/workstation are:

    * - Component
      - Requirement
    * - CPU / GPU
      - x86_64 [#jetson-nano]_, NVIDIA GPU required
    * - OS
      - Ubuntu 22.04 or 24.04
    * - Python
      - 3.11 / 3.12 / 3.13
    * - CUDA
      - 12.8 or newer
    * - NVIDIA Driver
      - 580.95.05 or newer
