MCAP Recording & Replay
========================

Isaac Teleop supports recording live tracking data to `MCAP <https://mcap.dev/>`_
files and replaying them offline through the same retargeting pipeline — no
headset or OpenXR runtime required during replay.

Recording a Live Session
-------------------------

Pass an ``McapRecordingConfig`` in the ``mcap_config`` field while keeping the
default ``SessionMode.LIVE``.  ``TeleopSession`` automatically discovers
trackers from the pipeline, so you only need to provide the output filename:

.. code-block:: python

   from isaacteleop.teleop_session_manager import TeleopSession, TeleopSessionConfig
   from isaacteleop.deviceio import McapRecordingConfig

   config = TeleopSessionConfig(
       app_name="MyApp",
       pipeline=pipeline,
       mcap_config=McapRecordingConfig("recording.mcap"),
   )

   with TeleopSession(config) as session:
       while True:
           result = session.step() # The tracker state is recorded to the MCAP file

When the context manager exits, the MCAP file is finalized and closed.

Auto-population and appending of tracker names
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``TeleopSession`` always auto-discovers trackers from the pipeline's DeviceIO
sources and uses each source's ``name`` as the MCAP channel name.  For
example, a pipeline with ``HeadSource(name="head")`` and
``HandsSource(name="hands")`` produces channels ``"head"`` and ``"hands"``.

Any ``(tracker, channel_name)`` pairs you pass explicitly via
``tracker_names`` are **appended** after the auto-discovered sources.  This is
useful for recording additional trackers that are not part of the pipeline:

.. code-block:: python

   from isaacteleop.deviceio import McapRecordingConfig

   extra_tracker = deviceio.HandTracker()

   mcap_config = McapRecordingConfig(
       "recording.mcap",
       [(extra_tracker, "extra_hands")],
   )

   # Final tracker list will be:
   #   [(head_source.tracker, "head"), (hands_source.tracker, "hands"),
   #    (extra_tracker, "extra_hands")]

Replaying a Recording
---------------------

Set ``mode=SessionMode.REPLAY`` and pass an ``McapReplayConfig``.  No OpenXR
session or headset connection is created — data is read directly from the MCAP
file:

.. code-block:: python

   from isaacteleop.teleop_session_manager import (
       TeleopSession,
       TeleopSessionConfig,
       SessionMode,
   )
   from isaacteleop.deviceio import McapReplayConfig

   config = TeleopSessionConfig(
       app_name="MyApp",
       pipeline=pipeline,
       mode=SessionMode.REPLAY,
       mcap_config=McapReplayConfig("recording.mcap"),
   )

   with TeleopSession(config) as session:
       while True:
           result = session.step()
           action = result["action"]
           # Process replayed action ...

Just like recording, trackers are auto-discovered from the pipeline and any
explicit ``tracker_names`` you provide are **appended** after them.  Use this
to add extra trackers that aren't part of the pipeline:

.. code-block:: python

   McapReplayConfig(
       "recording.mcap",
       [(extra_tracker, "extra_hands")],
   )

.. important::

   ``mcap_config`` is **required** when ``mode`` is ``SessionMode.REPLAY``.
   Omitting it raises ``ValueError``.

Schema compatibility
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Every recording embeds the FlatBuffer schema it was written under. Opening a replay
session compares every schema the recording carries against the schema the running
build was compiled from, and raises ``RuntimeError`` when the recorded bytes would be
misread — a recording made before a breaking schema change, for instance. The whole
recording is graded before the first frame is read, so replay never stops part-way
through for a schema reason.

That needs the list of schemas up front. It normally comes from the summary section at
the end of the file; a recording whose writer never got to flush one, which is what a
run cut short leaves behind, is scanned for its schema records instead. A recording so
damaged that neither route works is refused.

A difference that leaves every recorded field readable — a table field appended
since, or one marked ``(deprecated)`` — is reported on stderr and replayed instead.
There is no way to override the raise: a recording the running build would misread
is not replayable, and reading it anyway would hand back records whose field values
are quietly wrong. ``src/core/schema/README.md`` has the evolution rules that keep a
schema change from getting there.

Runnable Example
----------------

A complete record / replay example lives at
``examples/mcap_record_replay/python/``:

- ``common.py`` — pipeline builders (``build_hand_pipeline()``,
  ``build_controller_pipeline()``, ``build_full_body_pipeline()``) plus the
  ``HandJoints`` retargeter and the bone tables used by the replay
  visualizers.
- ``record_hand.py`` / ``replay_hand.py`` — records the ``hands`` channel
  from a live OpenXR session and replays it with a `viser
  <https://viser.studio/>`_ visualization of both hand skeletons (joint cloud
  + skeleton).
- ``record_controller.py`` / ``replay_controller.py`` — records the
  ``controllers`` channel and replays it in viser, including a per-controller
  HUD (thumbstick, trigger, squeeze, button states).
- ``live_full_body.py`` — live viser preview of the full-body skeleton from
  an active OpenXR session.
- ``record_full_body.py`` / ``replay_full_body.py`` — records the
  ``full_body`` + ``controllers`` channels and replays the body skeleton in
  viser.

Each pipeline wires only the ``Source`` nodes it needs, so the resulting MCAP
contains exactly the matching channels.  To capture more data, add
additional source nodes (``HeadSource``, ``ControllersSource``, …) in
``common.py``.

For a live browser view of **all** human DeviceIO trackers at once (hands, head,
controllers, and full body), see ``examples/deviceio_live_view/`` and its
``README.md``:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv pip install -e ./examples/deviceio_live_view
   python -m isaacteleop_examples.deviceio_live_view --accept-eula

A C++ recorder lives at ``examples/mcap_record_replay/cpp/``:

- ``record_full_body.cpp`` — records the ``full_body`` channel by passing a
  ``core::McapRecordingConfig`` to ``DeviceIOSession::run()``. It uses the
  same channel base name as ``FullBodySource``, so the resulting file replays
  with ``replay_full_body.py``.

Live preview
^^^^^^^^^^^^

From the example directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd examples/mcap_record_replay/python
   uv sync
   uv run python live_full_body.py --accept-eula
   uv run python live_full_body.py --port 8090 --accept-eula  # change viser port

Open the printed URL (default ``http://localhost:8080``) in a browser.  The
viewers bind every interface, since they run where the headset is and get
opened from another machine; pass ``--host 127.0.0.1`` to keep one local.

Recording
^^^^^^^^^

From the example directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd examples/mcap_record_replay/python
   uv sync
   uv run python record_hand.py            # 5 s → ../recordings/hands_<timestamp>.mcap
   uv run python record_hand.py 10         # record for 10 seconds
   uv run python record_hand.py 10 out.mcap  # custom output path

The example never downloads a published wheel — it runs against the
``isaacteleop`` next to it.  Above, ``uv sync`` builds it from this checkout; the
first sync compiles the extension modules and takes a few minutes, later ones
reuse the cached build, and the install is editable, so edits under
``src/python/`` need no rebuild.  From
``install/examples/mcap_record_replay/python`` (after ``cmake --install``) it
picks up the wheel you just built instead — see
:doc:`/getting_started/build_from_source/index`.

An active OpenXR runtime / headset must be connected, just like any other
live ``TeleopSession``.  Recording also needs the CloudXR runtime natives, which
a from-source build bundles only when the CloudXR SDK tarball is available —
CMake fetches it automatically, and warns rather than fails if it cannot.  Replay
has no such requirement.

Replaying
^^^^^^^^^

Replay runs headless — no headset required:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run python replay_hand.py                       # newest file in ../recordings/
   uv run python replay_hand.py path/to/file.mcap     # explicit file
   uv run python replay_hand.py --loop                # repeat until Ctrl+C
   uv run python replay_hand.py --port 8090           # change viser port

Open the printed URL (default ``http://localhost:8080``) in a browser to see the
left (green) and right (blue) hand skeletons update each frame.

The ``record_controller.py`` / ``replay_controller.py`` and
``record_full_body.py`` / ``replay_full_body.py`` pairs use the same CLI
(positional MCAP path, ``--host``, ``--port``, ``--loop``).
``live_full_body.py`` accepts ``--host``, ``--port``, and the CloudXR launcher
flags (including ``--accept-eula``).
