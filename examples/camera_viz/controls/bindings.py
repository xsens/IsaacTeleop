"""Controller bindings for camera_viz (Quest / Pico).

Right hand -- where the feed sits and how it reads in depth:

    thumbstick X   gap between the eyes' stereo planes, held to ramp;
                   on equirect, which has no gap to set, it pans the
                   panorama instead
    thumbstick     recenter: aim the surface at wherever you are looking
      click
    A              cycle lock mode (world -> head -> lazy)
    B              toggle mono / stereo

Left hand -- what surface it is mapped onto:

    X              cycle shape (quad -> cylinder -> equirect)
    Y              reset every parameter to the YAML values
    thumbstick     shape-dependent, see controls.shapes:
                     quad      X = size,   Y = height
                     cylinder  X = arc,    Y = height
                     equirect  X = h-span, Y = v-span

Input arrives through a ``ControllerTracker`` on a ``DeviceIOSession`` that
shares the OpenXR session Televiz owns, so there is one CloudXR connection
for rendering and input both. XR only -- window mode has no controllers.

Every limit below sits strictly inside what the layers validate, because
``set_placement`` raises on a bad value and this runs on the render thread.
