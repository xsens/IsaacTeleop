"""Event-driven run-loop for camera_viz.

VizRunner owns two threads:

  * **submit thread** — polls each source's ``latest()`` at ~1 kHz,
    calls ``layer.submit()`` on new frames, and notifies a
    condition variable.
  * **render thread** — waits on the condition. Wakes within ~µs of a
    new publish and calls ``session.render()``. A safety-net timeout
    re-runs render() periodically for window events / XR placement
    updates even without new frames.
