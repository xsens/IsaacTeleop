"""Shared infrastructure for camera_viz sources.

All vendor-SDK sources follow the same shape:

  1. Pre-allocate everything at construction (zero per-frame allocation):
     - two GPU buffers (double-buffered output, never reallocated)
     - one pinned host staging buffer (sized for the vendor's native layout)
     - a CUDA stream for async H2D + GPU color conversion

  2. Run a producer thread that:
     - polls / blocks on the SDK for the next frame,
     - memcpys into the pinned host buffer,
     - kicks off an async ``cudaMemcpyAsync`` H2D + color-convert on the
       producer stream,
     - synchronizes the stream so the consumer (renderer thread) can safely
       read the GPU buffer via ``submit(stream=0)`` — until the
       viz binding grows cross-stream sync (M6 review item #2), this is
       the only correct way to hand the buffer across threads,
     - flips the write/publish index atomically under a short lock.

  3. Survive disconnects without crashing the app:
     - the producer catches everything inside ``_grab()`` / ``_upload_and_convert()``,
     - transitions to a ``disconnected`` state with rate-limited reconnect,
     - subclasses classify fatal vs. transient via ``_grab()`` return value
       vs. exception (None = transient, exception = fatal).

Subclasses implement four hooks: ``_open_device``, ``_close_device``,
``_grab`` (returns host numpy or None), and ``_upload_and_convert`` (uploads
into the writable GPU buffer using ``self._stream``).
