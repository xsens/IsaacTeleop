"""CloudXR runtime settings, declared in the YAML instead of the process env.

The runtime takes its configuration from environment variables, and there are
three ways to set one and be silently wrong:

* a name nothing reads -- ``NV_CXR_DEVICE_PROFILE`` looks like its neighbours
  but the runtime reads ``NV_DEVICE_PROFILE``;
* a stale shell export -- the launcher writes ``~/.cloudxr/run/cloudxr.env``
  and tells you to source it, after which ``os.environ.setdefault`` here and
  even ``--cloudxr-device-profile`` both quietly lose to the sourced value;
* a bool spelled ``False``, which the runtime's exact-match parser does not
  recognise and therefore reads as **true**.

None of the three produces an error. So the settings go through the one tier
that outranks the process environment: a ``--cloudxr-env-config`` file, whose
entries beat both a shell export and the launcher's own defaults. Verified
against isaacteleop.cloudxr.env_config._load_resolve_and_apply, which merges
the file last.

Each of the three has a guard here: an unknown name warns with a suggestion,
the env file outranks the shell, and booleans are written in the one spelling
the parser reads as false.
