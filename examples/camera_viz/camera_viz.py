"""camera_viz — camera-feed visualizer for Isaac Teleop.

Reads the unified pipeline YAML (cameras + streaming + display) and
runs the receiver side: either opens the configured cameras directly
(``source: local``) or listens for matching RTP H.264 streams
(``source: rtp``) from a ``camera_streamer.py`` instance on the robot.

The same YAML file drives ``camera_streamer.py``, so both ends of an
RTP-mode deployment share one config.

Usage:
