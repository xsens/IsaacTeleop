"""A MuJoCo scene drawn into a Televiz XR session.

TeleopSession owns both halves: it creates the OpenXR session the trackers and the
compositor share, and runs the twin's frame loop on its own thread. This module holds no
mjModel and no mjData; it addresses the scene by name and publishes what moved. See
twin.py for that contract and README.md for the rest of the design.

Two cadences, deliberately: the control loop below is paced off the wall clock and the
render thread off the display. The head pose is the one thing that crosses back, read as
"where the operator was" and never as a per-frame signal.
