"""Engage-relative full-pose clutch retargeter for the SO-101 5-DOF arm.

Clutches the **full pose**: on every engage it re-latches *both* the home position and the home
orientation, so the operator can disengage, reposition their hand, and re-engage without the arm
moving. Each engaged frame emits::

    pos = home_pos + position_scale * (grip_pos - origin_pos)   # scaled translation
    rot = (R_ctrl @ R_origin^-1) @ R_home                       # base-frame delta, 1:1

On the engage frame ``grip_pos == origin_pos`` and ``R_ctrl == R_origin``, so the output is
*exactly* the home pose whatever the scale -- no teleport. Because the orientation delta is
**left**-composed (base frame), a hand rotation about base Z maps to an EE rotation about base Z.

Engagement is ``execution_state == RUNNING`` **and** ``squeeze > squeeze_threshold``. The two
conjuncts are different things and both are load-bearing: ``squeeze`` is *operator intent*, while
``execution_state`` is *system readiness*. An owning application that is still homing the arm
holds ``STOPPED`` so a squeeze cannot latch a home the arm has not reached yet.

Latching uses a **pending-latch sentinel**: ``_origin is None`` means "a latch is owed". The
sentinel is cleared (re-armed) on every disengaged, dropped, invalid or degenerate frame, so the
latch stays owed until a frame arrives that can be trusted to latch off. Both halves are
necessary -- arm-then-fire *without* the re-arm silently jumps when the operator releases and
re-squeezes across a tracking dropout, because the squeeze is unobservable inside the gap.

Home latching is deliberately **asymmetric**:

* the home **position** comes from the arm's measured EE pose when
  :data:`MEASURED_BASE_T_EE_INPUT` is connected, so an arm that sagged or was pushed while
  disengaged is not snapped back to a stale command;
* the home **orientation** is *always* the last commanded rotation, never the measurement. The
  5-DOF SO-101 tracks orientation only softly, so its measured wrist orientation persistently
  differs from the command; latching the measurement would inject that offset into the commanded
  signal on **every** re-clutch. Position has no such tracking gap.

On ``execution_events.reset`` the held pose is re-seeded from the **configured** home -- the
transform most recently supplied to the constructor or to :meth:`set_home_base_T_ee` -- and the
latch is re-armed. Seeding from a *static configured* transform rather than from live arm state is
what makes this safe: the reset pulse can reach this retargeter on either side of the owner's
actual teleport, so anything read from the arm at reset time is stale on one of those orderings.
The owning task is expected to slew the arm to that same configured pose on reset (Isaac Lab's
``init_state`` does exactly that), which is what makes the re-seed jump-free. An owner whose reset
does *not* move the arm should keep the configured home up to date with
:meth:`set_home_base_T_ee`, or simply not fire ``reset``.

That "never from live arm state" scopes to the **re-seed**, not to the whole frame. A frame that
carries ``reset`` can also latch the clutch, and the latch is unchanged by the re-seed having just
happened: the normal engage rule still applies, so on such a frame the home **position** comes from
:data:`MEASURED_BASE_T_EE_INPUT` when it is connected, not from the re-seed. Note that this does
not escape the ordering problem above -- ``GRIP_IS_VALID`` and the squeeze qualify the *controller*
pose, and say nothing about whether the arm has been teleported yet, so on a reset-before-teleport
ordering that measurement is the previous episode's arm state. No consumer wires both today. One
that does should either not fire ``reset`` on a frame it also engages, or leave the measured input
unwired. The re-seed's own job is unaffected: it defines what the retargeter holds, and re-latches
*from*, when nothing engages.

.. note::
   There is deliberately **no** ``orientation_offset`` parameter. It is not merely unnecessary
   here, it is *wrong*: appending a fixed offset gives ``(R_ctrl . R_origin^-1 . R_home) . R_off``,
   and on the engage frame ``R_ctrl == R_origin``, so the output is ``R_home . R_off != R_home`` --
   which breaks the no-teleport invariant. Worse, because ``_home_rot`` re-latches from the last
   *commanded* rotation, the error compounds as ``R_off``, ``R_off^2``, ``R_off^3`` over successive
   re-clutches. Do not re-add it.

.. note::
   Orientation **wind-up** is a real property of this algebra and is intentionally preserved: the
   commanded rotation is unbounded in SO(3) across repeated re-clutches, and ``wrist_roll`` sits in
   the null space of the 5-DOF position objective. Mitigating it would change behaviour.

Quaternion helpers are inlined below rather than imported: the equivalents in
``retargeting_engine/python/utilities/transform_utils.py`` (``_rotation_matrix_to_quat_xyzw`` at
``:116``, ``_quat_multiply_xyzw`` at ``:158``) are private to the engine layer. No SciPy either,
so this retargeter needs nothing beyond NumPy at install time.

        """Re-seed the held pose from a ``base_T_ee`` 4x4 transform.

        For owners that cannot know the arm's pose at construction time (the retargeting graph is
        built before the arm is homed). Both blocks are used, exactly as in the constructor. The
        supplied transform also becomes the **configured home** that a subsequent ``reset``
        re-seeds to, so an owner that re-homes its arm mid-session should call this rather than
        letting reset drag the arm back to the construction-time pose.

        Call this only while the clutch is not engaged -- the rule is about the engaged
        state, not the cadence. Once, while the session holds ``STOPPED``, makes the
        ordering unambiguous. Calling it on **every** non-engaged frame of a ``RUNNING``
        session is equally sound, and is what an owner whose arm moves while disengaged
        wants: the home stays on the arm's live pose, so an engage from anywhere is
        jump-free (``examples/robot_viz`` does this at frame rate).

        The pending latch is re-armed as a safety net rather than the call being rejected. Without
        it, a call made while engaged would leave the *old* controller origin latched against the
        *new* home, and the very next frame would command
        ``new_home + scale * (grip_pos - old_origin)`` -- a jump of ``new_home - old_home`` at
        servo speed. Re-arming bounds that: the next engaged frame re-latches rather than applying
        a stale delta. It does **not** make the call free. The re-latch still homes on whatever
        this call supplied, so the commanded pose still steps to the new home -- measured at
        0.0100 m with the measured-EE input connected versus 1.3398 m without it on the same
        sequence -- and the ORIENTATION snaps to the new home rotation either way, since it has no
        measured rescue path at all (90.00 deg in a single frame, measured). Raising would still
        be worse: this sits one call away from a frame-rate loop, where turning a jump into an
        unhandled exception leaves the arm uncommanded. Call it while disengaged.

        That is not in tension with the ``ValueError``\\ s below, which draw the line elsewhere: a
        **malformed argument** raises, because there is no pose to command from it and continuing
        would only defer the same failure to a wrong orientation nobody can trace. **Bad timing**
        never raises -- the transform is well-formed, the retargeter can keep commanding, and the
        cost is a bounded jump rather than an uncommanded arm.

        Args:
            home_base_T_ee: ``base_T_ee`` 4x4 transform [m]; its rotation block must be a proper
                rotation (orthonormal, ``det == +1``) and its bottom row ``[0, 0, 0, 1]``.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the transform is not 4x4, is not finite, has a bottom row other than
                ``[0, 0, 0, 1]``, or its rotation block is not a proper rotation. A scaled or
                reflected block would still normalize to a unit quaternion and command a quietly
                *wrong* orientation, with nothing downstream to catch it; the bottom-row check
                additionally catches a **transposed** transform, which is otherwise indistinguishable
                from a valid one. None of this can catch an inverted transform -- an ``ee_T_base``
                passed here is a perfectly well-formed 4x4 and is accepted.
