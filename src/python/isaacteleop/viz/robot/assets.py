"""The scenes each preview arm and its ghost gripper are drawn from, one per arm.

The MJCF wrappers are tracked package data; the upstream mesh and MJCF they name is
fetched, not vendored. Each ``ensure_*_scene`` assembles both halves into its own cache
directory and returns the scene path, gripper the ghost draws included.

Downloads are verified against a pinned commit: a raw.githubusercontent path is not
immutable in practice, and a substituted mesh renders as a broken arm rather than an error.
Everything lands flat, because MuJoCo drops an included file's own ``meshdir``; where a
ghost and its follower share a mesh, one of the two is named apart so the flat directory and
MuJoCo's global asset names can both hold them.
