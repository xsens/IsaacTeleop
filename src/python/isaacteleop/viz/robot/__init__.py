"""A teleoperated robot's digital twin, and the affordances that depend on it.

Not a general scene-graph or viewer API. The scene backend sits behind
:class:`RobotTwin`, and only :mod:`.scene` and :mod:`.frames` reach it; everything else
is numpy and duck typing. Those two are the wheel's only compiled scene code and their
backend is Linux-only (its OpenGL context is EGL), so they resolve lazily -- this package
still imports on a Windows Televiz build, and asking for :class:`SceneTwin` there raises.
