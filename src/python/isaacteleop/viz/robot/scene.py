"""A scene file, drawn as a robot twin. The only module here that names a scene backend.

The backend is a private MuJoCo shipped beside ``_robot_twin`` and reached through
``dlsym``, so whatever ``mujoco`` the caller's environment has is unrelated to it. Nothing
outside this module holds a scene handle, which is what keeps that true.

Not a scene graph: four things move (a body's pose, the joint array, a group's visibility,
a material's colour) and one is measured, a frame's offset from another, once, at load. Do
not add a per-frame ``pose_of(site)``; it would be a kinematics service on the render
thread. The thread boundary is :meth:`SceneTwin.publish` -- after
:meth:`SceneTwin.create` the scene belongs to the render thread alone.
