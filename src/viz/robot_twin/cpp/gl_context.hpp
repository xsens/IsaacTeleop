// A headless OpenGL context, made through EGL's device platform so it needs no display,
// no X server and no Wayland compositor. It replaces `mujoco.GLContext`, whose only job
// here was this -- and which came attached to a whole `mujoco` wheel.
//
// EGL is reached through dlopen, like the GL entry points in gl.hpp: libEGL is already
// in the process on any machine that can run this, and a link-time dependency would put
// it on the wheel's NEEDED list for machines that cannot.
