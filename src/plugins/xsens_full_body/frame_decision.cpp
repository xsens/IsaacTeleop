 * @brief Full FlatBuffers bounds check on a payload before it is trusted.
 *
 * Mandatory, and easy to skip by accident: `deserialize_teleop_frame` validates *framing* only
 * and never looks inside the payload. It also cannot use a generated `VerifyFullBodyPoseBuffer`,
 * because the schema's `root_type` is `FullBodyPoseRecord` and flatc emits no verifier for a
 * non-root table -- hence `VerifyBuffer<FullBodyPose>` by hand.
